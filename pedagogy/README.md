#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the assign values to  variables <br> |Remember | Recall 
2.| User will be able to: <br> Understand the usability of a temporary variable  | Understand  | Understand
3.| User will be able to: <br>Apply the concept of exchange values of two variables| Apply | Apply

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment 

<u> <b>Description: </b> During the experiment, student will perceive at which memory block which value exists. It means student is familiar with the changes in the values of the variables, and all the results will be known to the student during experiment, so it is the case of expository instructional strategy.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to <br>Recall the assign values to variables | User will assign input values to variables | Q1.   Data type of values should be <br> <b> A. int or float</b><br> B. string <br> Q2. When data type of values are not declare, which error occors? <br> A. Runtime error <br> <b> B. Compile-time error </b>
2.| User will be able to<br> understand the usability of a temporary variable | User will perform <br> <ul> <li> Passing value of first variable to a temporary variable.</li><li> Passing value of temporary variable to second variable </li> | Q1. What will be the value of temp after execution of given code if a=3 and b=6:<br>temp=a;<br>a=b;<br>b=temp;<br> <b> A. 3 </b> <br> B. 6
3.| User will be able to<br> exchange values of two variables | Student will perform <br> <ul> <li> Passing value of first variable to a temporary variable.</li><li>Passing value of second variable to first variable</li><li> Passing value of temporary variable to second variable </li> | Q1. Which code will perform swapping(exchange) of variables. <br> A. temp=a; b=temp; a=b; <br> <b> B. temp=a; a=b; b=temp; </b>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|<ul><li> Student inputs numbers in the textbox</li> <li> Student will click <b> OK </b> button.</li> | Simulator will fetch information and store in the variable box  | The purpose is to get values from user which simulator have to swap.
2.|<ul><li>Student will click on the <b> Next </b> button </li><li> Student will repeat step 2 until the program has been terminated. </li>|Simulator will show stepwise how compiler performs task line by line <br>  | The purpose is to explore student's mind how compiler works against a Programming language and visualize the theory of working of compiler as well as memory cells so the student will learn easily.
