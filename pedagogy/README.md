#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative assessment 

<u> <b>Description: </b> Simulator will show code of swapping of two numbers. </u>
<br>
 Simulator will take input and then it will show the whole code to the user, when the user clicks on next button the code will run one by one and at the same time the output box will show how these codes actually works.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| Students will be able to <br> assign values to  variables | Student will assign values to variables | Q1.   Data type of values should be <br> <b> A. Same type</b><br> B. Different type <br> Q2. When assign different data type values, problem which occurs <br> A. Runtime error <br> <b> B. Compile-time error </b>
2.| Students will be able to<br> exchange values of two variables | Student will perform <br> <ul> <li> Passing value of first variable to a temporary variable.</li><li>Passing value of second variable to first variable</li><li> Passing value of first variable to a temporary variable </li> | Q1. The student firstly can assign value of second variable to temp variable then value of first variable to second variable,  after that value of temp to second variable <br> <b> A. Yes </b> <br> B. No
3.| <ul> <li> User will be able to apply knowledge of swapping </li><li> In analyzing further problems </li></ul> | Student will assign values to variables | Q1. The problems where swapping can be applied <br> A. Searching based <br> <b> B. Sorting based </b>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.|<ul><li> Student inputs numbers in the textbox</li> <li> Student will click <b> OK </b> button.</li> | Simulator will fetch information and store in the variable box  | The purpose is to get values which simulator have to swap.
2.|<ul><li>Student will click on the <b> Next </b> button </li><li> Student will repeat step 2 until the program has been terminated. </li>|Simulator will show stepwise how compiler performs task line by line <br>  | The purpose is to explore student's mind how compiler works against a Programming language and visualize the theory of working of compiler so the student will learn easily.
